# 283. Move Zeroes

## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


Sample Inputs and Outputs:

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Constraints:

```
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 104
2. -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```
